# Wiring in Series
Now that you've gained some experience working with connecting components to the Arduino, it's time to examine two different methods for wiring.

Components that are wired in _series_ are connected along a **single path**, resulting in the **same current** flowing through all the connected components.

One of the key considerations is that if any part of the series is removed or broken, the entire circuit stops working because it'll become **open**. Since there is only one path for the current to flow, any openings in that path will cause the current to stop working.

The [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_and_parallel_circuits) provides a great example of this concept: Consider what happens when a single bulb on a string of holiday lights burnt out. If these were wired in a series, as they previously were for several years, the entire string of bulbs would stop working!

## Current and Resistance
Since the same current is flowing throughout the entire series, the current is the same value for all attached components. However, resistance works differently. The total resistance in a _series circuit_ is equal to their sums. This is just something to consider when working with resistors and series circuits.

## Activity: Create a Series Circuit
The best way to illustrate this concept is to actually create a series circuit. Keep in mind that this is an example activity that's designed to demonstrate how this type of circuit works and provide you an opportunity to practice this concept.
