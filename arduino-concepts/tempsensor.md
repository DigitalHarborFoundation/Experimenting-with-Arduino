# Temperature Sensors

Another type of _analog input_ sensor that you're going to be using is a _temperature sensor_. This sensor requires you to use an _analog input pin_ such any pin between A0 - A5. These are found on the other side of the board from what you've previously been using.

## Introducing the Temperature Sensor
The _temperature sensor_ doesn't act like a resistor like the photoresistor. Instead, you're going to need to be actively reading the input from the pin.

This guide will cover the basic circuit setup as well as a basic sketch that shows how to integrate a temperature sensor into your projects.

Once you understand this process, you can repeat it and modify it to suit the needs of your projects.

## Project: Temperature Gauge
This project is intended to be a basic introduction to the temperature sensor. You'll be reading the values from the sensor and then using that information to activate other components.

### Supplies
- Uno and breadboard
- Jumper wires
- Temperature sensor

### Steps
The steps for this project are split between the circuit setup and the sketch itself. Since this sketch introduces new commands, there will be a section explaining each new command.

#### Circuit
Refer to this _fritzing diagram_ for the circuit setup:
