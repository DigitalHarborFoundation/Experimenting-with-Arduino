## Capstone Project
For the capstone project you'll need to create a **new** project that uses at least **one input** and **one output**.

The project prompt is open-ended. You can use an earlier project as inspiration but the capstone should be something new. You have the remainder of the camp to build it, so make sure to follow the design process and keep track of your progress and iterations!

You're free to use _any combination_ of inputs and outputs for this project, as long as you use one of each.

## Refresher: Inputs and Outputs
Here's a list of the various inputs and output components that you've used throughout the course. Each input component is listed as either digital or analog.

### Inputs:
- Tactile Pushbutton
- Potentiometer
- Photoresistor
- Force Sensitive Resistor (FSR)
- Tilt Sensor

### Outputs:
- LEDs
- Servo Motor
- Piezo Speaker
- RGB/Diffused LED

## Getting Started
You should experiment with building out physical components for your projects and feel free to combine multiple inputs and outputs. Consider this project to be the culminating demonstration of the skills that you've developed throughout this course. One of the key benefits of working with Arduino is that they're able to be integrated into a variety of projects and constructions. Be creative with it and have fun!
